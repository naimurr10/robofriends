# Robofriends React App

Welcome to our React app project! This project was initiated with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

To start the development server, run:

### `npm start`

This command launches the app in development mode. It will automatically open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your default browser. The page will reload whenever you make changes, and lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Available Scripts
